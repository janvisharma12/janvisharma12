# Hi there, I'm Janvi Sharma 👋

### 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm currently pursuing my **BTech in Computer Science and Engineering**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML)**. My journey in tech revolves around learning and building machine learning projects. I'm passionate about leveraging data and AI to solve real-world problems.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, C++, SQL
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Databases**: MySQL

### 🚀 Projects
Here are a few of the projects I've been working on:
- **[Project 1: CinePal](#https://github.com/janvisharma12/CinePal)**  
  Description: CinePal is a machine learning-powered movie recommendation system designed to help users discover new films based on their viewing history and preferences. Leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models, CinePal provides personalized movie suggestions tailored to each user's unique taste.
  
- **[Project 2: Prime Detect](#https://github.com/janvisharma12/Prime-Detect)**  
  Description: Detecting products from Amazon displayed in movies or series on Prime Video presents a unique challenge for traditional object detection models. With the vast number of products available on Amazon, it's impractical to gather sufficient training samples for each class.
  
- **More projects coming soon...**
